For solving logic puzzle instances like those specified by the fact files in
the '../instances' folder, the logic-puzzles.lp file needs to extended with
general rules characterizing solutions that satisfy the clues in the instances.

Automated correctness checks that reproduce computed solutions in case of
success can be run with the correctness checking encoding in the check.lp file.
